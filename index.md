## Prompts
**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** \
    The most interesting topic we've discussed in my domain thus far has been leveraging human genetic variation to identify the genes/snps associated with disease. Most diseases do not follow this Mendelian, monogenic inheritance. Rather, there are usually an accumulation of genes/snps or a certain combination of these alleles that might make one more susceptible to disease. I find this really interesting, especially since humans are 99.9% alike with genetic variation only accounting for 0.1% of our genome. Thus, its interesting to see how a certain combinations of snps/alleles contribute to disease. \
**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.** \
     A potential investigation could be the identification of the significant snps that contribute towards the expression of a certain disease. For example, using bim/bed/fam files for individuals as our dataset and the expression levels for a certain disease like Heart Disease or Alzheimers's, we can identify specifically which genetic components contribute most to manifestation of the disease. \
**3. What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?** \
     I think a potential change I would make would be the topic of our polygenic risk scores. So far, we have constructed polygenic risk scores using height gwas data. While this is an interesting application of what we have been learning and a good way to learn to contruct polygenic risk scores, I would like to explore genetic risk perhaps with another disease or multiple diseases such that the work can be seen in application of preventative health medicine, identifiying risk factors associated with certain diseases. \
**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?** \
    Some other techniques that could be interesting for my project could be fine mapping which involves identifying alleles associated with causing a certain trait. We could do this with cis-eQTLs or perhaps probability or statistical models. Another approach we could take is Gene Enrichment Analysis which examines whether a predetermiend set of genes is actually statistically significant in causing a certain trait or disease of which we could use different statistical tests to determine.
